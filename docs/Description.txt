We are looking for an AI-Native Developer who combines strong Python engineering
skills with the ability to use AI tools and spec-driven development to deliver
end-to-end conversational AI solutions.

You will work closely with architects to create executable specifications that
define system behavior, using AI to generate, validate, and refine code
throughout the development lifecycle.

This role supports the development of Client Concierge conversational solutions
— systems that deliver high personalization, cross-channel continuity, and
proactive outcome completion for users.


KEY RESPONSIBILITIES

• Deliver end-to-end conversational AI features based on collaboratively
defined executable specifications.
• Partner with architects to translate business logic and process definitions
into structured specifications that guide implementation.
• Use AI-assisted tooling for code generation, refinement, testing, and
workflow optimization.
• Develop backend services and integrations that support multi-turn,
personalized, and context-aware conversational experiences.
• Ensure conversation logic maintains continuity across channels and supports
proactive task completion.
• Continuously improve development speed and quality through systematic use of
AI augmentation.


REQUIRED SKILLS

• Strong Python development experience, including backend services and
integrations.
• Experience with spec-driven applied in real projects.
• Hands-on experience integrating applications with LLMs (prompting,
tool/function calling, reasoning patterns).
• Ability to design and implement conversational logic, state management, and
API-driven workflows.
• Practical experience using AI coding assistants in daily development work.
• Ability to work independently in a fast-paced, iterative delivery
environment.


PREFERRED / NICE TO HAVE

• Experience building or integrating Conversational AI or Agentic AI
components.
• Exposure to RAG, context management, conversational memory, agentic
patterns.
• Experience integrating conversational systems with enterprise APIs and cloud
environments (any cloud).
• Understanding of multi-channel experience design (chat, voice, web).


IMPACT

You will define how AI-augmented development is executed in practice — using
specifications and AI-driven tooling to deliver complete conversational
solutions with greater speed, consistency, and intelligence.

Your work will directly advance a next-generation Client Concierge experience
capable of handling outcomes end-to-end with personalization and proactive
assistance.
